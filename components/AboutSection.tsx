        <p className="mb-4">
          I’m a pre-medical student passionate about neurotechnology, cognition, and the interplay
          between brain and language. My research experience spans brain-computer interfaces, speech
          decoding, and neural oscillation studies.

          This site is a space to share what I’m working on, thinking about, or experimenting with.
          Whether it’s building devices, writing on memory and language, or reflecting on the
          neuroscience of communication — it lives here.
